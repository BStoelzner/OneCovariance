KiDS-1000 covariance
--------------------
The standard ``config.ini`` (after you pulled the directory) will run a simplified KiDS-1000-like cosmic shear setup. Not all parameters specified in the ``config.ini`` are used and it is merely used as an explanatory file to explain all the parameters which can be set.
Let us take a closer look at the output: Since a plot for the correlation coefficient was requested, we have:

With the corresponding covariance saved in ``covariance_matrix.mat``. A complete list of all the entries can be found in the ``covariance_list.dat`` file as shown below.
